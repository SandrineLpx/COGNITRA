AUTOMOTIVE COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE BRIEF
Period: 2026-01-26 to 2026-02-12 (Publish date)
Prepared by: Cognitra AI

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
*   Apex Mobility faces significantly divergent demand across key regions, necessitating agile resource allocation and sales strategy adjustments for closure systems. India's passenger vehicle market expanded robustly with a 29.0% year-over-year (YoY) jump in December 2025 shipments and is projected to grow 7.7% in 2026, contrasting sharply with Germany's market decline of 6.6% in January 2026. (REC:b2fea01bb1ec, REC:b01fe54f0ab5)
*   Pressure on premium OEM profitability could translate into heightened pricing demands and potentially slower new program investments for Apex Mobility's advanced closure systems, particularly on higher-content vehicles. Mercedes-Benz Group reported a 9.2% YoY revenue decline and a significant drop in adjusted return on sales for its Cars division from 8.1% in 2024 to 5.0% in 2025. (REC:0d8b2829d58b)
*   The accelerating shift towards electric vehicles (BEVs) is fundamentally reshaping demand for door-module content and requires Apex Mobility to proactively align its product roadmap for future platforms. Traditional ICE vehicle registrations experienced steep declines (e.g., gasoline down 29.9% YoY in Germany, 48.9% in Western Europe in January), contrasted with significant BEV growth (23.8% in Germany, 52.1% in France). (REC:b01fe54f0ab5, REC:2f16b6647a12)
*   OEMs' increasing focus on localized production and new EV/SUV model launches in emerging markets presents distinct opportunities for Apex Mobility to secure new closure system content but necessitates adaptable regional supply chains. Hyundai Motor Malaysia plans to launch Ioniq N EVs and locally assemble Tucson and Santa Fe SUVs in Malaysia in Q2 2026, signaling a commitment to regional manufacturing. (REC:03c70b6bc95a)

<summary>HIGH PRIORITY DEVELOPMENTS</summary>

*   **Mercedes-Benz Group** — Reported revenue of EUR 132.2 billion (down 9.2% YoY) and unit sales for Mercedes-Benz Cars decreased 9.2% YoY to 1,801,291 vehicles in 2025. The adjusted return on sales for Mercedes-Benz Cars stood at 5.0% in 2025, a reduction from 8.1% in 2024, despite xEV deliveries increasing 0.3% to 368,700 units, representing a 20.5% share of total sales. (REC:0d8b2829d58b)
Supplier Implications: Apex Mobility should anticipate potential pricing pressure on existing Mercedes-Benz programs and a cautious approach to new platform investments, requiring proactive cost management and value engineering discussions for high-content closure systems.
*   **German Passenger Car Market** — Registrations declined 6.6% year-over-year in January 2026, driven by a 14.4% YoY fall in private registrations, while commercial registrations rose 2.1% YoY. BEV registrations increased 23.8% YoY to account for 22.0% of new registrations, in stark contrast to gasoline vehicle registrations falling 29.9% YoY and diesel registrations dropping 17.1% YoY. (REC:b01fe54f0ab5)
Supplier Implications: This market contraction, especially in private sales, suggests reduced volume demand for closure systems in Germany for traditional ICE platforms, but also highlights an accelerating opportunity for EV-related content.
*   **Western European Passenger Car Market** — Overall registrations across Western Europe fell 2.7% year over year in January to 860,319 units, with Germany and France both experiencing 6.6% declines. Gasoline car registrations fell 48.9% and diesel by 49.1% in January, while BEV registrations in France grew 52.1% YoY to 30,308 units, capturing a 28.3% market share. (REC:2f16b6647a12)
*   **Indian Passenger Vehicle Market** — Experienced strong growth in December 2025, with shipments jumping 29.0% year over year to 349,170 units. Full-year 2025 passenger vehicle dispatches hit a record 4.49 million units, a 5.0% year-over-year increase, supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions and a GST cut on small cars, buses, and CVs. (REC:b2fea01bb1ec)
Supplier Implications: This robust growth in India signals increased demand for Apex Mobility's closure systems, necessitating a review of production capacity and supply chain resilience to support key OEMs like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra in the region.
*   **Hyundai Motor Malaysia** — Outlined plans to launch the Ioniq 5 N and Ioniq 6 N EVs in Q2 2026, alongside CKD (Completely Knocked Down) versions of the Tucson and Santa Fe SUVs. Both SUVs will be locally assembled at Sime Motors’ Inokom plant in Kulim, Kedah, with plans to expand the dealership network from 12 to 25 outlets in 2026. (REC:03c70b6bc95a)
Supplier Implications: Apex Mobility has an opportunity to capture new closure system business for these upcoming Hyundai EV and SUV models in Malaysia, particularly for components supporting local assembly and potentially higher-tech solutions for performance EVs.

<summary>CONFLICTS & UNCERTAINTY</summary>

*   Future projections for Mercedes-Benz Group EBIT are stated to be "significantly above 2025 levels" but lack concrete figures or committed actions beyond general 'Next Level Performance' measures. This introduces uncertainty regarding the pace and magnitude of their financial recovery and its potential impact on supplier relationships and program stability. (REC:0d8b2829d58b)
*   S&P Global Mobility projects Indian light vehicle sales to grow 7.7% in 2026 to 5.56 million units (REC:b2fea01bb1ec). While this forecast is positive, it depends on "favorable macroeconomic conditions, new model launches, and supportive policies" which could be subject to change, introducing a degree of uncertainty in sustained market growth.
*   The overall decline in Western European passenger car registrations (2.7% YoY in January) is noted, but key insights suggest "fleet sales (rental, company cars) are compensating for declines" in private customer registrations. This makes the true underlying health of the market, particularly for high-margin private sales, uncertain and could mask broader consumer hesitancy. (REC:2f16b6647a12)
