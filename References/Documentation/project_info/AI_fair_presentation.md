# MSIS 549 — GenAI and Agentic Fair Presentation
## Why This Assignment Matters
In the workplace, your ability to build something is only as valuable as your ability to show it to others and get them excited about it. Product managers pitch to leadership. Founders demo to investors. Engineers present to cross-functional teams. In every case, the skill is the same: take something complex you've built, distill it to its essence, and communicate it clearly to someone who has never seen it — all while the tool is running live in front of them.

The GenAI and Agentic Fair is your chance to practice this. You'll stand at a booth with your working prototype, and a rotating audience of instructors, alumni, and peers will stop by to see what you've built. There are no slides to hide behind and no pre-recorded safety net — just you, your tool, and your ability to make a compelling case for why it matters. This is as close to a real product demo as it gets in a classroom setting, and it's a skill that will differentiate you in your career.

## Overview
The GenAI and Agentic Fair is an interactive poster-session-style showcase. Each student will have a dedicated space to demonstrate their AI-powered project with live demonstrations on their computer. Alumni of the program will attend the fair and award tokens to their favorite projects, recognizing creativity, technical execution, and practical impact.

Your grade for this assignment is based on the quality of your live demonstration and your ability to communicate your work to diverse audiences. The alumni token voting determines separate awards and recognition but does not directly affect your grade — though it will likely correlate with the quality of your demo.

## Format
Requirement	Details
Format	In-person live demonstration at your booth
Supporting materials	Optional — you may use any materials you find helpful (printed poster, one-pager, slides on screen, etc.), but nothing beyond the live demo is required
Presentation style	Organic conversation — graders will visit your booth and you'll walk them through your tool. There is no fixed time limit, but you should be able to deliver a clear, compelling walkthrough in a few minutes
Deadline	The fair takes place during class (see course schedule on the syllabus)

## What to Prepare
1. Your Working Tool
This is the centerpiece. Your tool must be live, functional, and ready to demo. Make sure it works reliably — nothing undermines a demo faster than a tool that crashes. Have a backup plan (e.g., a second browser tab with a pre-loaded result) in case something goes wrong.

2. Your Pitch
When someone walks up to your booth, you should be able to:
- Hook them in 15 seconds — what problem does your tool solve, and why should they care?
- Show it live in 2–3 minutes — walk through a real use case from input to output, highlighting what makes your tool impressive
- Go deeper if they're interested — be ready to discuss your technical architecture, design decisions, and evaluation approach
- Handle questions — judges and alumni will ask follow-ups. The best demos feel like a conversation, not a monologue
- Optional Supporting Materials
You may bring or display anything that helps communicate your project and make your booth memorable. Think of this as your trade-show moment — the best booths at a real product fair don't just have a laptop on a table. 

Some ideas:
- QR code linking to your live tool so visitors can try it on their own phone or laptop while you talk them through it. This is highly encouraged — letting someone interact with your tool firsthand is far more convincing than watching you click through it.
- A printed poster summarizing your problem, solution, and architecture
- A one-page handout visitors can take with them
- A few slides running on your screen alongside the demo
- Architecture diagrams or flowcharts
- Physical props or objects that bring your problem domain to life. If your tool helps with meal planning, bring sample meal cards. If it analyzes sports data, bring a scoreboard mockup. Props make your booth stand out and give visitors something tangible to connect with.
- Costumes or role-play elements — if it makes sense for your project, lean into it. Building a travel planning agent? Dress the part. Creating a fitness coach bot? Wear a whistle. This isn't required and shouldn't feel forced, but if a costume or persona fits your project naturally, it can make your presentation more engaging and memorable. Have fun with it.
- These are not graded directly, but strong supporting materials can make your communication clearer, your booth more inviting, and your demo more memorable — all of which help with both the rubric and alumni voting.

- Grading Rubric (100 points — worth 20% of your final grade)
This assignment is graded out of 100 points. Your score is then scaled to 20% of your final course grade.

- Grading is a mix of rubric-guided scoring during the fair and holistic assessment afterward. The instructors and TAs will visit your booth, experience your demo, and evaluate you on the criteria below.

Each section is graded on this scale:

## Level	Score
Excellent	100% of points
Good	85% of points
Satisfactory	70% of points
Needs Improvement	50% of points
Insufficient	0–25% of points

1. Problem-Solution Fit (20 points)
Sub-criterion	Points
Clear, meaningful problem	10
Convincing connection between problem and tool	10
Excellent: The problem is real, specific, and well-motivated. It's immediately clear why the tool exists and who benefits from it. The solution directly and convincingly addresses the stated problem.

Needs Improvement: The problem is vague or the connection between the problem and the tool is unclear. The visitor leaves unsure of why the tool was built.

2. Tool Functionality & Polish (30 points)
Sub-criterion	Points
Tool works reliably during the demo	12
Quality and usefulness of outputs	10
User experience and interface design	8
Excellent: The tool runs smoothly with no crashes or errors. Outputs are useful, well-formatted, and clearly valuable. The interface is intuitive and well-designed — it feels like a real product, not a rough prototype.

Needs Improvement: The tool crashes, produces poor outputs, or is difficult to use. The demo requires significant explanation just to navigate the interface.

3. Communication & Presentation (25 points)
Sub-criterion	Points
Clarity and structure of the walkthrough	10
Ability to adapt to different audiences	8
Handling of questions and follow-ups	7
Excellent: The walkthrough is clear, well-paced, and tells a compelling story. The student reads the audience and adjusts depth accordingly — concise for casual visitors, detailed for technical judges. Questions are handled confidently and thoughtfully.

Needs Improvement: The walkthrough is disorganized or hard to follow. The student delivers the same scripted pitch regardless of who's listening. Questions are deflected or answered vaguely.

4. Innovation & Creativity (25 points)
Sub-criterion	Points
Originality of the solution	12
Creative use of AI tools and APIs	13
Excellent: The solution goes beyond obvious applications of AI. The student has found a creative angle — whether in the problem they chose, the way they combined tools, or the user experience they designed. It's clear the student thought deeply about what to build, not just how to build it.

Needs Improvement: The tool is a straightforward application of a tutorial or template with little original thinking. The AI usage is generic and could apply to any problem.

Alumni Token Voting & Awards
Alumni attendees will receive tokens to award to their favorite projects. This voting determines awards and recognition — it does not directly affect your assignment grade. However, the qualities that earn alumni votes (clear communication, impressive functionality, creative solutions) are the same qualities the grading rubric rewards, so a strong demo tends to perform well on both.

Awards may include categories such as:

Best Overall Project
Most Creative Solution
Best Technical Implementation
Best Business Application
Tech for a Better World
Award categories and criteria may be updated before the fair.

## Tips for a Great Fair Demo
- Test everything the morning of. APIs go down, tokens expire, Wi-Fi drops. Give yourself time to fix issues before the fair starts.
- Have a backup plan. Pre-load a successful run in a separate tab or take screenshots. If something breaks live, you can still walk through the results.
- Lead with the problem, not the tech. Visitors care about why before how. Start with the pain point, then show the solution.
- Show, don't tell. Run the tool live. Let the visitor see real inputs produce real outputs. A live demo is worth a thousand slides.
- Let visitors try it themselves. Print a QR code that links to your tool so people can interact with it on their own device. There's no better way to prove your tool works than letting someone use it unprompted.
- Practice your opening line. The first 15 seconds when someone walks up set the tone. Know exactly how you'll hook them.
- Make your booth stand out. Props, costumes, printed materials — anything that makes your booth visually interesting will draw more visitors, which means more chances to impress.
- Be ready to go deep. Some visitors will want the technical details. Know your architecture, your design tradeoffs, and your evaluation approach.
- Energy matters. You'll be presenting repeatedly for an extended period. Stay enthusiastic — your energy is contagious.
- Keep water nearby. You'll be talking a lot.
