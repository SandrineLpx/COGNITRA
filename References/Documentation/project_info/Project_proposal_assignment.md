MSIS 549 Individual Project Proposal
Overview
The MSIS 549 project is your opportunity to apply generative AI technologies to create an innovative solution to a clear problem or pain point. Your proposal should demonstrate how you'll leverage generative AI to address meaningful business or societal challenges.

This proposal is graded for completion only (Pass/Fail).

Submission Requirements
Create a concise proposal document (1-2 pages) that includes:

1. Your Information
Your name and email
2. Elevator Pitch
You can structure your product pitch in this format (feel free to adapt, this is an example):

"A lot of [target customers] struggle with [pain point], which costs them [consequence]. So I built [product], a [simple category description] that helps them [clear result] by [simple mechanism]. Unlike [competitor or outdated method], my solution [key differentiator]."

Example: "A lot of small business owners struggle with creating professional websites, which costs them potential customers and credibility. So I want to build Loovabeul, an AI-powered website builder that helps them launch a complete site in under 10 minutes by simply describing their business. Unlike traditional website builders, my solution generates custom designs and content tailored to their specific industry."

3. Project Description
Problem statement and its significance – What problem are you solving and why does it matter?

How AI technologies will address this problem – Be specific about how AI helps 

Target users – Who will benefit from your solution?

Data sources (if applicable) – What information or data will your solution use?

Anticipated challenges – What obstacles do you expect to face? What specific questions do you have for the instructor?

4. Implementation Plan
Type of solution: Will you build an AI agent, dashboard, web app, or website?

Specific generative AI technologies you plan to use (e.g., ChatGPT API, Claude, Gemini, Lovable, or other AI tools we've covered in class)

Technical approach and methodology – How will you build this?

Demo concept: What do you plan to showcase at the GenAI & Agentic Fair?

GenAI & Agentic Fair Guidelines
Your project will be showcased at the GenAI & Agentic Fair in an exhibition format. We will probably have three 50-min rotations to give everyone an opportunity to visit their classmates' work.

Presentation Format:
Individual presentation at your dedicated space.

Live demonstration of your working tool on your computer/phone or any device of your choice whenever someone new comes to see your work.

Supporting materials: You may use printed documents, posters, visual aids, or objects of your choice. 

Alumni judges and faculty will visit your station, view your demo, and award tokens to their favorite projects. At the end of the fair, we will award several prizes!

What to Prepare:
Working, accessible tool that others can interact with

Clear explanation of the problem you're solving

Live demo (have a backup plan in case of technical issues)

Focus on storytelling: Make it easy for judges to understand why your solution matters. And sometimes, remember that "fake it until you make it" can be a viable method in pitch sessions! But be ready to defend the feasibility of your product.

Key Elements to Highlight:
Choose the 1-2 most compelling strengths of your project:

Business value and real-world applicability

Technical innovation and creative AI use

User experience and functionality

Social impact or addressing an important need

Scalability or growth potential

Submission Process
Create your proposal in a Google Doc (1-2 pages)
Share the document with editor rights: leobix@uw.edu, am007@uw.edu, archer95@uw.edu
Submit the Google Docs link to the Canvas assignment.
Evaluation Criteria
Beyond the agentic fair, your project will be evaluated by the teaching team on:

✓ Creativity in applying generative AI technologies
✓ Clear problem-solution fit
✓ Technical quality of your solution
✓ Functionality and user experience
✓ Potential impact of the proposed solution
✓ Presentation quality and demo effectiveness at the Fair

Tips for Success
Start simple and iterate – Build a minimum viable/lovable version first

Choose a problem you care about – Your passion will show in your work

Test with real users – Get feedback early and often

Think beyond obvious AI applications – Show creative problem-solving

Prepare backup plans – Have screenshots or recordings in case of demo issues

Focus on the problem first – Judges care most about the value you're creating, not just the technology

Make it accessible – Ensure others can actually use or interact with your tool
