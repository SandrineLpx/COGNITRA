## Primary Topics

### 1. OEM Strategy & Powertrain Shifts ⚠️ CRITICAL FOR FORECASTING

**Scope:** OEM electrification strategy changes, EV slowdowns, hybrid resurgence, investment pivots, powertrain diversification

**Why This is Topic #1:**
OEM strategy shifts are the **single most important leading indicator** for closure systems demand. When OEMs delay EV programs, restart ICE production, or pivot to hybrids, it directly impacts:
- Which closure technologies are needed (EV-specific vs. traditional)
- Production volumes and timing
- Cost pressure on suppliers
- Technology investment priorities

**Sub-categories:**
- EV target delays, cancellations, or slowdowns
- Hybrid strategy announcements (HEV, PHEV emphasis)
- ICE investment resumption (gas engine development)
- Profitability concerns and financial write-downs
- Platform decisions (dedicated EV vs. multi-powertrain)
- Regional strategy divergence

**Keywords to watch:**
- **Strategy Shifts:** delay, postpone, scale back, revise, abandon, pivot, reset, recalibrate
- **EV Slowdowns:** EV slowdown, BEV target missed, production target cut, timeline extension
- **Hybrid Resurgence:** hybrid emphasis, PHEV strategy, HEV investment, dual powertrain
- **ICE Return:** ICE investment, gas-powered, Hemi V8, internal combustion, traditional powertrain
- **Financial Impact:** write-down, charge, loss, profitability challenge, $19.5 billion (Ford), $1.6 billion (GM)
- **Demand Issues:** consumer demand softening, demand not meeting expectations, policy-driven vs consumer-driven
- **Specific Targets:** 2030 target, 2035 goal, 100% electric by, electrification timeline
- **Mixed Strategy:** diversified powertrain, flexible platform, multi-energy, technology agnostic

**Recent Examples (2024-2025):**
- GM: Delayed battery plant to 2027, Cadillac backed off all-EV 2030 goal
- Ford: $19.5B writedown, canceled Lightning/3-row SUV/commercial van, pivoting to hybrids
- Stellantis: Killing base EV Charger, delayed Ram EV, bringing back Hemi V8
- Mercedes-Benz: Delayed 50% electrified target by 5 years to 2030
- Volvo: Dropped 100% electrified 2030 to "90-100%"
- Honda, Nissan, Porsche, Jaguar: Scaled back or canceled EV plans

**Strategic Implications for Closure Systems:**
- **EV-specific closures** (frameless, soft-close electric, lightweight) → slower growth than projected
- **Hybrid closures** → emerging opportunity, different power/weight requirements
- **ICE closures** → extended life, potential volume increase
- **Cost pressure** → OEMs cutting losses will pressure supplier pricing
- **Platform flexibility** → need for closure systems that work across powertrains

**Priority Assessment:**
- **HIGH Priority:** Any major OEM announces EV delay, hybrid pivot, or ICE investment
- **HIGH Priority:** Financial writedowns related to EV programs (signals deeper issues)
- **MEDIUM Priority:** Incremental target adjustments, market-specific strategy changes
- **Track Closely:** Regional divergence (e.g., Europe vs. US vs. China strategies)
