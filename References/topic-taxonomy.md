# Topic Taxonomy (Closure Systems Focus)

This taxonomy defines the only allowed topic labels for this project. Use these labels exactly (spelling and punctuation).

## Canonical topics (multi-label, 1–3 per item)

- OEM Strategy & Powertrain Shifts
- Closure Technology & Innovation
- OEM Programs & Vehicle Platforms
- Regulatory & Safety
- Supply Chain & Manufacturing
- Technology Partnerships & Components
- Market & Competition
- Financial & Business Performance
- Executive & Organizational

## Guidance for consistent tagging

### OEM Strategy & Powertrain Shifts
Use for:
- OEM strategic pivots (ICE/HEV/PHEV/BEV mix, autonomy/software-first, vertical integration, platform resets)
- Manufacturing footprint changes tied to strategy (localization, nearshoring, major capacity moves)
Do not use for:
- Single program updates without a broader strategy angle (use OEM Programs & Vehicle Platforms)

### Closure Technology & Innovation
Use for:
- Latches, cinching, handles, power closures, smart entry, UWB/digital key, anti-theft, access systems, door modules
- Performance/safety improvements tied to closures (e.g., child safety, anti-pinch, fail-safe)
Do not use for:
- General vehicle electronics unrelated to entry/closures (use Technology Partnerships & Components)

### OEM Programs & Vehicle Platforms
Use for:
- Program-level announcements (new model launches, refreshes, platform rollouts, sourcing decisions per program)
- Program timing changes that affect volume or content
Do not use for:
- Broad OEM strategy narratives (use OEM Strategy & Powertrain Shifts)

### Regulatory & Safety
Use for:
- Regulations, standards, safety compliance, recalls, cybersecurity rules affecting access/closures
- CO2/efficiency rules when they materially change program content or market mix
Do not use for:
- General political news without policy action (use Market & Competition or Supply Chain & Manufacturing)

### Supply Chain & Manufacturing
Use for:
- Plant openings/closures, disruptions, logistics, capacity constraints, labor actions, supplier footprint moves
- Tariffs/sanctions/logistics constraints when they directly impact supply chain execution
Do not use for:
- Pure financial performance without operational impact (use Financial & Business Performance)

### Technology Partnerships & Components
Use for:
- Partnerships, component sourcing, platform tech stacks that impact closures/access (chips, sensors, connectivity, software stacks)
- Supplier collaborations where the technology component is central
Do not use for:
- Purely commercial alliances without tech/component substance (use Market & Competition)

### Market & Competition
Use for:
- Market demand/registrations, incentives, competitive positioning, pricing actions, tariff policy that affects market dynamics
- Competitor comparisons, share shifts, segment trends
Do not use for:
- Internal exec changes (use Executive & Organizational)

### Financial & Business Performance
Use for:
- Earnings, guidance, major capex plans, funding/IPO/M&A, restructurings, insolvency risk (financial lens)
Do not use for:
- Executive churn without financial lens (use Executive & Organizational)

### Executive & Organizational
Use for:
- Leadership changes, governance issues, organizational restructuring, board/shareholder dynamics
- Culture/people signals affecting execution
Do not use for:
- M&A purely as a transaction (use Financial & Business Performance)

## Footprint regions and roll-up rules (for region tagging)

Footprint regions:
- India
- China
- Europe (including Russia)
- Africa
- US
- Mexico
- Thailand

Rules:
- Always capture `country_mentions` for any countries explicitly mentioned.
- Europe (including Russia) includes UK and Turkey and Russia; broad mentions like Europe, EU, European, EMEA map here.
- Africa roll-up is primarily driven by production footprint: Morocco and South Africa (also tag Africa on broad mentions).
