Mitsuba to double Indian business sales in FY2030, invest JPY 9 billion over next three years   [ India ] IND

Mitsuba Corporation (Mitsuba) aims to approximately double its Indian business sales from the fiscal year that ended in March 2025 (FY2024) to JPY 70 billion in FY2030, and achieve a 5-fold increase in operating profit. The company aims to raise its share in the Indian market for products such as its main motorcycle engine accessories and windshield wipers, and plans to enter the electric motorcycle drive parts market, which is expected to grow. Mitsuba will invest JPY 9 billion over the next three years to strengthen its system and develop the Indian business as a new profit pillar, including the establishment of a new research and development site and converting its existing warehouse into a plant. The company aims to achieve sales of about JPY 30 billion in the motorcycle engine accessory business in FY2030, and raise its market share in India from 40% in FY2024 to 50% in FY2030. Depending on the growth of the Indian market, the company will consider further investment. Mitsuba, whose sales has recently been sluggish in China and Europe, where Japanese automakers are facing difficulties, plans to reduce fixed costs with a view to reorganizing its business sites. The company will invest financial resources raised from these rationalizing measures into the Indian business to improve profitability.

Business Reorganization
Mitsuba to consolidate automotive starter motor production to Japan by 2030
Mitsuba Corporation (Mitsuba) plans to consolidate production for automotive starter motors to its plants in Japan by around 2030. The company currently produces automotive starter motors in Japan, the U.S., and India. Mitsuba, which decided that there will be inevitable declines in mid- and long-term demand due to electrification, aims to improve business efficiency by consolidating production. At the same time, the company will establish a production system that can cope with high-variety, low-volume production. It will allocate freed-up managerial resources for next-generation products such as those for electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, sales of its engine accessories and other products for internal combustion engine vehicles account for about 90% of its total automotive business sales. Since demand for internal combustion engine products is expected to decrease for the medium-to-long term due to the shift to electrified vehicles, Mitsuba plans to increase sales of hybrid, electric, and other electrified vehicle products to about 20% of its automotive business sales in the fiscal year that starts in April 2027 (FY 2027).
