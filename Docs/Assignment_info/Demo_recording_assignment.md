# MSIS 549 — Demo Recording Assignment
## Why This Assignment Matters
When a product manager or rapid prototyper hands off a solution to an engineering team, a written spec alone is rarely enough. Engineers need to see the tool in action — the user flow, the decision points, the edge cases — to truly understand what they're being asked to rebuild. That's why demo walkthroughs are a staple of the product handoff process: they bridge the gap between documentation and lived experience.

Your demo recording serves this exact purpose. Think of it as the companion to your technical report. The report is the written blueprint; the demo is the live tour of the working prototype. Together, they give a team everything they need to take your proof of concept and build it into a production-quality product.

This is a skill you'll use constantly in your career — whether you're pitching internally at a company, presenting to stakeholders, onboarding a new engineer, or fundraising for a startup.

## Overview
You will submit a recorded walkthrough demonstration of your AI-powered tool. The demo allows you to showcase your solution in greater depth than possible during the limited GenAI and Agentic Fair presentation.

Think of this as a guided tour of your working prototype for an engineering team that needs to rebuild it. By the end of the video, a viewer should understand what your tool does, how it works, and why the design decisions you made are the right ones.

## Format Requirements
Requirement	Details
Format	Recorded video (screen recording with audio narration)
Length	2–5 minutes (longer is fine if content is relevant)
Submission	Submit the URL link on Canvas (host on Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
Include link in report	Embed the link to your demo video in your Technical Report PDF
Deadline	Refer to the course schedule on the syllabus
Recording Tools
Any screen-recording tool is fine. Here are some popular options:

Loom — free tier available, easy to use and share
Zoom — record a meeting with yourself, share your screen
Panopto — available through UW
Riverside — browser-based recording

## What to Cover
Your demo should walk through your tool's functionality, features, and implementation. At minimum, include:

1. Introduction (~30 seconds)
Briefly state the problem your tool solves and who it's for
Give a one-sentence overview of what the tool does
2. End-to-End Walkthrough (~2–3 minutes)
This is the core of your demo. Show your tool running on a real input from start to finish:

The input you provide to the system — make it clear what a user would give
The workflow/agent in action — show how the system processes the input (e.g., how agents are invoked, what APIs are called, how the tool orchestrates its steps)
The final output — show the result the user receives and explain why it's useful
Key features — highlight the most important or impressive capabilities of your tool
Edge case or interesting scenario — if time permits, show how your tool handles an unusual or challenging input

3. Technical Explanation (~1 minute)
Go beyond the surface. Briefly explain:

The architecture or design of your system (tools, APIs, models used)
One or two key technical decisions you made and why
How you would evaluate whether the tool is working well (mention a metric or criterion)

4. Wrap-Up (~15 seconds)
Summarize what makes your tool valuable
Mention one thing you'd improve with more time
Grading Rubric (100 points — worth 5% of your final grade)
This assignment is graded out of 100 points. Your score is then scaled to 5% of your final course grade.

Sub-criterion	Points	Description
Clarity of demonstration	25	The demo is well-paced, easy to follow, and clearly shows the tool in use. Inputs, processing, and outputs are all visible and understandable.
Comprehensive coverage of tool functionality	25	The demo covers the full range of the tool's capabilities. No major features are skipped. The viewer gets a complete picture of what the tool can do.
Technical explanation during demo	50	The narration goes beyond showing buttons — it explains how the system works, what design decisions were made, and how success is measured. Demonstrates depth of understanding.

Level	Score
Excellent (85–100)	Clear, well-paced demo covering the full end-to-end workflow. Technical explanations are insightful and demonstrate deep understanding.
Good (70–84)	Demo is solid with minor gaps in coverage or clarity. Technical depth is adequate but could go further.
Satisfactory (50–69)	Demo covers the basics but is hard to follow, skips steps, or lacks technical depth.
Needs Improvement (25–49)	Demo is incomplete or unclear. Little technical explanation.
Insufficient (0–24)	No video submitted, or video is too short/unclear to understand what the system does.
Tips for a Great Demo
Practice before recording. Run through the demo once or twice so it flows smoothly. You don't need to be perfect, but you should be comfortable.
Don't over-edit. Spend no more than 30–60 minutes on the recording itself. Imperfection is okay.
Narrate as you go. Explain what you're doing and why — don't just click through silently.
Show real inputs. Use a realistic example, not dummy data. This makes the demo far more compelling.
Keep it concise. 2–5 minutes is a guideline, not a minimum to fill. A focused 3-minute demo beats a rambling 5-minute one.
Test your link. Before submitting, make sure your video URL works and is accessible (not restricted to your account only).
