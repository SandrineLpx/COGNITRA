Market Intelligence Agent - Project Journey
Date January 2026
Student Market Analyst, Automotive Tier-1 Supplier
Course MSIS 549 (GenAI for Business Applications)
Timeline 4 weeks

The Problem
Reality One-person market intelligence team spending 15+ hoursweek manually searching automotive industry news across multiple sources (Bloomberg articles, Automotive News, Reuters, industry publications).
Pain Intelligence arrives too late for strategic decisions. Colleagues ask What's happening with TeslaBYDCATL but by the time I search and synthesize, the moment has passed.

The Question

Can I build an AI agent that monitors automotive news and delivers daily intelligence briefings

Initial Concern Not sure about data accessibility
Breakthrough Realization I already have access to Bloomberg subscription, Automotive News, Reuters, Google Patents, press releases. The job isn't accessing secret data—it's aggregating and synthesizing public information faster than humans can manually.

Project Selection Two Options
Option A First Aid Decision Support (Ski Patrol)

Pros Personal passion, humanitarian impact, emotionally compelling
Cons Not career-relevant, no test users at work, separate from day job

Option B Market Intelligence Agent

Pros Solves actual work problem, built-in test users (colleagues), can work on during business hours, uses existing company infrastructure
Cons Need manager buy-in, corporate environment constraints

Decision Market Intelligence Agent
Rationale Career impact + time efficiency + built-in validation  personal passion (First Aid remains future personal project)

Scope Evolution
Initial Idea (Too Broad)
Monitor entire automotive industry, all companies, all topics, dailyweeklymonthly reports, financial analysis, patent tracking, regulatory monitoring
Problem Unachievable in 4 weeks
Refined Scope (MVP)
Core Feature News Intelligence

Monitor 3-4 sources (Bloomberg articles, Automotive News, Reuters, Google Patents)
Track 21 companies (13 OEMs BMW, BYD, Ford, GM, etc. + 8 Tier-1 suppliers Brose, Huf, Magna, etc.)
10 topic categories (EV Transition, Door Systems, Supply Chain, etc.)
AI summarization Key Developments (facts) + Strategic Implications (analysis for Apex Mobility)
Deliver via SharePoint library with searchable metadata

Bonus Feature (Week 3-4) Financial Intelligence

Track quarterly earnings for 3 OEMs (VW, Tesla, Toyota)
Extract key financial metrics
Add to same SharePoint library

Result Achievable core + impressive bonus = comprehensive solution

Key Architecture Decisions
1. Two-Column Summary Format
Evolution

V1 Single AI Summary paragraph → Too dense, hard to scan
V2 Single Key Points bullets → Better, but mixed facts with analysis
V3 Two columns → FINAL

Key Developments (3-4 bullets) What happened, who, when, numbers
Strategic Implications (2-3 bullets) What this means for Apex Mobility



Why It Works

Engineers read left (tech details)
Strategists read right (competitive implications)
Executives read both (takes 30 seconds)
Scannable Review 10 articles in 5 minutes

Example
Key DevelopmentsStrategic Implications• BMW investing €1B in Mexican EV facility• Partnership with Magna for door systems• 200K annual capacity by 2027• Door system opportunities in Mexico• Competitive threat Magna expanding• Potential Apex Mobility-BMW discussions

2. Configuration-Driven Design
Student Insight

What about keeping company names and topics in CSV files instead of hard-coding them

This showed professional engineering thinking.
Solution
00_Config
├── companies.csv      (21 companies)
├── topics.csv         (10 categories)
├── sources.csv        (9 sources)
├── regions.csv        (5 regions)
└── keywords.csv       (30+ monitoring terms)
Benefits

Single source of truth Update CSV → regenerate prompt → update SharePoint
Easy maintenance Add new company = 5 minutes vs. 2 hours of code changes
Scalable Add 50 companies without touching code
Audit trail Git tracks what changed when

vs. Hard-Coding Everything

Company list in prompt ❌
Company list in SharePoint ❌
Company list in documentation ❌
Change company → update 10 places ❌


3. Technology Stack
Options Considered

Zapier + Perplexity Easiest but limited control, monthly costs
Custom Python Full control but requires coding skills (don't have), time-intensive
Microsoft 365 + Azure OpenAI Leverages existing company infrastructure

Decision Microsoft 365 Stack

Storage SharePoint (already using site GL-MC-MarketInsights)
Automation Power Automate (no-code)
AI Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) or fallback to OpenAI API
Delivery Microsoft Teams (daily digests)

Why

Zero additional cost (already have M365 license)
No setup time (already have SharePoint site)
Colleagues familiar with these tools
Real deployment path after course


4. SharePoint Structure
Decision Two libraries, same site
GL-MC-MarketInsights
├── Digital Press (existing - keep unchanged)
│   └── Manual white papers, webinars, presentations
└── Auto Intelligence (new - automated)
    └── Automated daily articles + AI summaries
Why Not Single Library

Clean testing environment
No disruption to existing workflow
Easy to show before vs. after
Can merge later if successful


5. Metadata Schema (10 Columns)

Understand what good output looks like

Week 2 Automation Phase 1 (6-7 hours)
Scale the proven solution

Build Power Automate flows
Connect to Azure OpenAI API
Automate Bloomberg article monitoring
Test with real articles
Success criteria First automated summary delivered

Week 3 Expansion (6 hours)
Add features based on Week 1-2 learnings

Add more sources (Automotive News, Reuters)
Weekly synthesis report
User feedback iteration
Financial tracking (bonus if time)

Week 4 Polish & Demo (7 hours)
Make it presentation-ready

Documentation complete
Error handling
Demo materials (poster, script)

Critical Insights (Thinking Process)
1. Start with Problem, Not Technology
Wrong I want to use AI for something cool
Right I waste 15 hoursweek searching news. How can AI help
Every design decision traced back to Does this save time Improve intelligence quality Help colleagues
2. Real  Hypothetical
Hypothetical Build intelligence system for automotive
Real I have 5 colleagues who need this. My manager will fund it if it works. Demo to alumni judges Feb 11.
Real stakes = real feedback = real learning
3. Embrace Constraints, Don't Fight Them
Constraints

4 weeks timeline
No coding background
Must use company infrastructure
5-8 hoursweek available

How constraints helped

Forced focus on MVP (no scope creep)
Chose no-code tools (Power Automate)
Used existing SharePoint (zero setup)
Created urgency


Constraints breed creativity. Infinite resources breed waste.

4. Validate Early, Iterate Fast
Week 1 Friday validation prevents Week 4 disasters

Manual testing Week 1 → learn colleagues want facts separated from analysis
Adjust to two-column format Week 2
vs. Building automation Week 1-3, discovering Week 4 it doesn't meet needs (no time to fix)

5. Configuration  Hard-Coding
Student intuition Don't hard-code company names
This is professional software engineering thinking

Separation of concerns (data vs. code)
Single source of truth (CSV files)
Easy maintenance (add company = 5 min not 2 hrs)
Scalability (100 companies without architecture change)

6. Documentation as Design Tool
Writing SKILL.md forced clarity

What are configuration files
How do they connect
Who maintains what


If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

Documentation revealed design gaps, improved actual system.

Why This Specific Solution Works
1. Leverages What's Available

SharePoint already exists (no setup)
Bloomberg subscription already paid for (no new cost)
Power Automate included in M365 (no new tool)
Colleagues familiar with interface (no training)

2. Solves Real, Measurable Problem

Current state 15 hrsweek manual search
Future state 30 minweek reviewing summaries
ROI 14.5 hoursweek saved

3. Achievable in 4 Weeks

Week 1 Manual proof of concept
Week 2 Automation working
Week 3 Feature expansion
Week 4 Demo polish

4. Showcases AI Capabilities

LLM summarization (GPT-4)
Prompt engineering (two-column format)
Multi-document synthesis (weekly reports)
Human-AI collaboration (review + approve workflow)

5. Professional Engineering

Configuration-driven (CSV files)
Documented (SKILL.md with YAML)
Version controlled (git-ready)
Maintainable long-term

6. Real Deployment Path

Not just academic exercise
Company can use post-course
Colleagues already testing
Manager aware and supportive


The Decision Framework (Meta)
Every choice traced back to

Does it solve the core problem (Speed + quality intelligence)
Is it achievable in 4 weeks (Given constraints)
Can colleagues use it (Not just demo-ware)
Is it maintainable (After course ends)
Does it demonstrate AI skills (For learning objectives)

If answer to any question is no → reconsider the choice

Key Takeaway

Start with real problem. Build simplest solution that works. Test with actual users immediately. Iterate based on feedback. Ship in 4 weeks, improve forever.

This is how professional AI systems get built.

Week 4 Polish both

Option 3 Python-First (If you prefer)

Skip Power Automate entirely
Build with Python + libraries

Automation schedule (cron jobs), watchdog (file monitoring)
SharePoint Office365-REST-Python-Client or shareplum
AI openai library (GPT-4 API)
Data pandas, openpyxl (Excel), PyPDF2 (PDF extraction)




Updated Week 2-3 Options (With Python)
Week 2 Automation
Option A Power Automate (No-Code)

Faster setup (2-3 hours)
Easy Teams integration
Non-technical colleagues can maintain

Option B Python Script (Code)
python# Example Bloomberg email monitor
import imaplib
import email
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd

# Monitor inbox for Bloomberg alerts
# Extract article text
# Call OpenAI API for summarization
# Write to SharePoint via API
# Post to Teams webhook
My Recommendation Start with Power Automate Week 2 (fast), add Python Week 3 (powerful)

What Python Enables (Week 3-4 Enhancements)
1. Financial Data Extraction (Your Bonus Feature)
Week 3 Python Script
pythonimport pandas as pd
import PyPDF2
from openai import OpenAI

def extract_financials_from_earnings(pdf_path)
    
    Extract revenue, profit, EV sales from quarterly earnings PDF
    
    # Extract text from PDF
    text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)
    
    # Use GPT-4 with structured output
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=gpt-4-turbo,
        messages=[{
            role user,
            content fExtract financial metrics as JSONn{text}
        }],
        response_format={type json_object}
    )
    
    # Parse JSON to DataFrame
    financials = pd.DataFrame(response.json())
    
    # Save to CSV
    financials.to_csv('financials.csv', index=False)
    
    return financials

# Example usage
tesla_q4 = extract_financials_from_earnings('Tesla_Q4_2025_Earnings.pdf')
Output CSV
csvCompany,Quarter,Revenue_Billions,Operating_Profit_Millions,EV_Sales_Units,R&D_Spend_Millions
Tesla,Q4 2025,25.2,3200,485000,1100
VW,Q4 2025,78.5,4100,175000,3800
Toyota,Q4 2025,72.1,5200,95000,2900
Load to SharePoint Use Office365-REST-Python-Client library

2. Advanced Analytics
Trend Detection
pythonimport pandas as pd
from collections import Counter

def detect_emerging_trends(summaries_df, weeks=4)
    
    Analyze last 4 weeks of summaries for emerging keywords
    
    recent = summaries_df[summaries_df['Date'] = pd.Timestamp.now() - pd.Timedelta(weeks=weeks)]
    
    # Extract keywords from Strategic Implications
    all_text = ' '.join(recent['Strategic_Implications'])
    words = all_text.lower().split()
    
    # Count frequency
    keyword_freq = Counter(words)
    trending = keyword_freq.most_common(20)
    
    return trending

# Example solid-state mentioned 15 times this month vs. 3 last month
Competitive Intelligence Dashboard
pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def competitor_mentions_chart(summaries_df)
    
    Chart How often are Magna, Brose, Huf mentioned
    
    competitors = ['Magna', 'Brose', 'Huf', 'Witte']
    
    mentions = {}
    for comp in competitors
        count = summaries_df['Company'].str.contains(comp).sum()
        mentions[comp] = count
    
    plt.bar(mentions.keys(), mentions.values())
    plt.title('Competitor Mentions (Last 30 Days)')
    plt.savefig('competitor_activity.png')

3. Data Quality Checks
Automated Validation
pythondef validate_sharepoint_data(df)
    
    Check data quality before publishing
    
    issues = []
    
    # Check for required fields
    if df['Company'].isna().any()
        issues.append(Missing company tags)
    
    # Check for duplicate URLs
    if df['Original_URL'].duplicated().any()
        issues.append(Duplicate articles detected)
    
    # Check summary length (should be 50-200 words)
    df['word_count'] = df['Key_Developments'].str.split().str.len()
    if (df['word_count']  50).any()
        issues.append(Summaries too short)
    
    return issues

# Run before uploading to SharePoint

4. Custom Prompt Generation (Already Planned)
Your prompt_generator.py script
pythonimport csv
import pandas as pd

def generate_prompt_from_config()
    
    Read CSV configs, generate AI prompt
    
    companies = pd.read_csv('00_Configcompanies.csv')
    topics = pd.read_csv('00_Configtopics.csv')
    
    company_list = ', '.join(companies['CompanyName'])
    topic_list = ', '.join(topics['TopicName'])
    
    # Fill template
    with open('prompt_template.txt', 'r') as f
        template = f.read()
    
    prompt = template.replace('{{COMPANY_LIST}}', company_list)
    prompt = prompt.replace('{{TOPIC_LIST}}', topic_list)
    
    with open('current_prompt.txt', 'w') as f
        f.write(prompt)
    
    print(fGenerated prompt with {len(companies)} companies, {len(topics)} topics)

generate_prompt_from_config()
```

AI Technologies Specific Problem → Solution Mapping
Problem 1 Information Overload
Human Challenge 50-100 articlesweek across multiple sources, impossible to read everything
AI Solution Extractive + Abstractive Summarization
Technology GPT-4 Turbo (175B parameters, 128K context window)
How It Works

Input 1,500-word Bloomberg article
AI Processing

Identifies key sentences (extractive)
Rewrites in concise format (abstractive)
Maintains factual accuracy
Removes redundancy


Output 3-4 bullet points (100-150 words)

Specific AI Capability

Attention Mechanism Transformer model weighs importance of each sentence
Semantic Compression Understands This represents a major shift in EV strategy vs. The company said this is important (removes fluff)

Result

Before 10 minutes to read article
After 30 seconds to scan summary
Time Saved 95% reduction in reading time


Problem 2 Context Loss
Human Challenge Articles assume industry knowledge, buried lede, implicit meanings
AI Solution Context-Aware Analysis
Technology Large Language Model with pre-training on automotive corpus
Example
Raw Article Text

BMW has selected Inteva Products for its Next Generation platform door modules, marking a significant departure from its traditional supplier base.

Human Analyst Might Miss

Traditional supplier base = BMW historically used BroseMagna
Significant departure = competitive threat signal
Next Generation platform = affects multiple vehicle models (high volume)

AI Analysis (GPT-4 with domain prompt)
Key Developments

BMW awards door module contract to Inteva for Next Gen platform
Replaces incumbent suppliers Brose and Magna
Next Gen platform 500K+ annual units across 357 Series

Strategic Implications

Threat BMW diversifying away from traditional German suppliers
Opportunity Inteva's value proposition (cost innovation) worth investigating
Context Aligns with BMW's cost reduction strategy announced Q2 2025

AI Capabilities Used

Implicit Relationship Understanding Knows BMW-Brose-Magna historical partnerships
Inference Departure from traditional base → identifies who's losing
Volume Estimation Next Gen platform → estimates production impact
Trend Connection Links to prior BMW cost reduction announcements

How AI Does This

Pre-trained on automotive industry text (press releases, trade publications, earnings calls)
Fine-tuned with Apex Mobility-specific context (competitors, customers, products)
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pulls relevant historical context


Problem 3 Inconsistent Categorization
Human Challenge Same topic described differently across sources (BEV, EV, battery electric, electric vehicle, plug-in)
AI Solution Semantic Classification
Technology GPT-4 Multi-Label Classification + Embedding-Based Similarity
Example Articles
Article 1 Tesla ramps up 4680 cell production at Gigafactory Texas
Article 2 BYD's blade battery technology gains European OEM interest
Article 3 Solid-state batteries Toyota targets 2027 production start
Human Categorization Problem

Different keywords 4680 cell vs. blade battery vs. solid-state
Easy to mis-categorize or tag inconsistently
Keyword matching fails Article doesn't say Battery Technology explicitly

AI Categorization
All three tagged as Vehicle Electrification & Powertrains + Battery Technology (if that's a subcategory)
How AI Decides

Semantic Understanding Knows 4680 cell and blade battery and solid-state are all battery technologies
Context Awareness Gigafactory + production → manufacturing topic too
Multi-Label Assigns multiple relevant categories (not just one)

Technical Implementation
python# AI Prompt Engineering (Classification)
prompt = f
Analyze this article and select ALL relevant topic categories.

Article {article_text}

Available Categories {topic_list_from_csv}

Selection Criteria
- A category is relevant if the article substantively discusses it
- Select multiple if article spans topics
- Consider both explicit mentions and implicit context

Output as JSON array [Category1, Category2]


response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=gpt-4-turbo,
    messages=[{role user, content prompt}],
    response_format={type json_object}  # Structured output
)

categories = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
AI Advantages Over Rule-Based

Semantic matching Understands concepts, not just keywords
Context-aware Battery in battery lawsuit ≠ battery technology
Multi-label Correctly assigns multiple relevant categories
Adaptive Learns from examples (few-shot learning)


Problem 4 Lack of Strategic Insight
Human Challenge Articles report facts, but analysts need implications
AI Solution Perspective-Taking Analysis
Technology GPT-4 with Custom System Prompt (Domain-Specific Reasoning)
System Prompt Design
pythonsystem_prompt = 
You are a senior competitive intelligence analyst for Apex Mobility, 
a tier-1 automotive supplier specializing in door locking systems 
and access control.

Your expertise includes
- Door module design (mechanical, mechatronic, electronic)
- OEM partnership dynamics (BMW, VW, Mercedes, etc.)
- Competitive landscape (Brose, Huf, Magna, Witte)
- Industry trends (vehicle electrification, smart access, lightweight materials)

When analyzing articles, you evaluate
1. Direct impact on Apex Mobility's productsmarkets
2. Competitive threats or opportunities
3. OEM strategy shifts affecting supplier relationships
4. Technology trends requiring innovation response

Provide strategic implications from Apex Mobility's perspective.

Example
Article Rivian announces partnership with Samsung SDI for cylindrical battery cells
AI-Generated Strategic Implications
✅ What AI Infers (Beyond Article Text)
Direct Implications

Rivian's battery partnership → vehicle design changes → potential door system integration requirements
Cylindrical cells (vs. pouch) → different thermal management → different door sealinsulation requirements

Competitive Context

Samsung SDI expanding in NA → supply chain localization trend → Apex Mobility should evaluate Mexico manufacturing
Rivian diversifying suppliers → open to new tier-1 relationships → partnership opportunity window

Market Positioning

Rivian scaling production (battery deal signals volume intent) → targets 200K+ units by 2027 → door system opportunity
EV startups maturing → moving from get to market to optimize cost → price pressure on suppliers

Technology Trends

Battery standardization (cylindrical) → potential platform sharing across OEMs → modular door designs gain importance

How AI Generates This

Direct Analysis Article mentions Rivian + Samsung SDI + batteries
Inference Chain

Batteries → vehicle architecture
Vehicle architecture → component integration
Component integration → door systems affected


Competitive Context Retrieval (RAG)

Query memory Previous Rivian announcements
Query memory Samsung SDI partnerships
Synthesize This is part of larger trend...


Perspective-Taking

From Apex Mobility's view, what matters here
Focus on door systems, partnerships, opportunities



This is NOT simple text extraction - this is reasoning.

Final Answer Where AI Fits
AI is the intelligence extraction and synthesis engine in a 3-layer architecture

Collection Layer (Power Automate) Gather raw articles
AI Intelligence Layer (GPT-4) Extract, categorize, summarize, analyze, synthesize
Delivery Layer (SharePointTeams) Store and distribute to humans

AI specifically solves

Information overload → Summarization
Context loss → Domain-aware analysis
Inconsistent categorization → Semantic classification
Lack of strategic insight → Perspective-taking reasoning
Volume scaling → Parallel processing
Manual data extraction → Structured extraction
Weekly synthesis → Multi-document aggregation

Without AI 15 hoursweek manual work, limited to 5 articlesday
With AI 30 minutesweek review, scales to 50+ articlesday
That's the transformation.
